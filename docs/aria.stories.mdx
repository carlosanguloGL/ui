# What is aria config
If a component uses accessibility attributes they can be provided globally using an aria configuration for each component, similar to theming.
With this functionality, you can apply a different language or diferent values to accessibility attributes across all components.

**Important**: not all components need aria configuration.

# Injection
When an aria config is `provided` in an upper component or app, then the component get its value using the `provide/inject` pattern.
Here is an example of the injection of a component custom aria config:

```js
import { setComponentAriaConfig } from '@uicr/core'
...
setup() {
    const myCustomAria: UiButtonAriaConfigModel = {
      ...
    }
    setComponentAriaConfig(UiButton, myCustomAria)
}
```

in this example `setComponentAriaConfig` is a function provided by the ui library common package that receives two params:
 - the component that will be configured, from which it will stract the TAG_NAME constant.
 - the custom aria config that will replace the default.

# Multiple components
Sometimes we want multiple components to change its aria config, to avoid calling multiple times the same function a function is provided for this purpose called `setAriaConfig`.
Here is an example:

```js
import { setAriaConfig } from '@uicr/core'
...
setup() {
  const customAriaUiButtonClose = { ... }
  const customAriaUiAlert = { ... }

  setAriaConfig({
    [UiButtonClose.TAG_NAME]: customAriaUiButtonClose,
    [UiAlert.TAG_NAME]: customAriaUiAlert,
  })
}
```

As you can see by providing a structure with the type `{ [key as string]: object }` where the key is the component TAG_NAME and the value is the aria config we want to replace.

# Model

Each component defines its own aria config model usually your will find it in the form `Ui<Name>AriaConfigModel` for example `UiAlertAriaConfigModel`.
This interface allows easy application of an aria config based on its properties.

# TAG_NAME
To define the key that each component needs to inject it's aria config a TAG_NAME is associated for ALL components in the library.
This key is also used in the theme injection.
