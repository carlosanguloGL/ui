# What is a theme
The whole idea behind UI library is to be theme agnostic, so each component does not use a css class or a tag directly into the template but one that is configured in an injected object.
Each component uses a configuration model for the theme and each one has its defaults in case no injection is provided.

# Injection
When a theme is `provided` in an upper component or app, then the component get its value using the `provide/inject` pattern.
Here is an example of the injection of a component custom theme:

```js
import { setComponentThemeConfig } from '@uicr/core'
...
setup() {
    const myCustomTheme: UiButtonThemeConfigModel = {
      ...
    }
    setComponentThemeConfig(UiButton, myCustomTheme)
}
```

in this example `setComponentThemeConfig` is a function provided by the ui library common package that receives two params:
 - the component that will be configured, from which it will stract the TAG_NAME constant.
 - the custom theme that will replace the default.

# Multiple components
Sometimes we want multiple components to change its theme, to do this another function is provided for this purpose called `setThemeConfig`.
Here is an example:

```js
import { setThemeConfig } from '@uicr/core'
...
setup() {
  const customThemeUiTransition = { ... }
  const customThemeUiButtonClose = { ... }
  const customThemeUiAlert = { ... }

  setThemeConfig({
    [UiTransition.TAG_NAME]: customThemeUiTransition,
    [UiButtonClose.TAG_NAME]: customThemeUiButtonClose,
    [UiAlert.TAG_NAME]: customThemeUiAlert,
  })
}
```

As you can see by providing a structure with the type `{ [key as string]: object }` where the key is the component TAG_NAME and the value is the theme we want to replace.

# Model

Each component defines its own theme model usually your will find it in the form `Ui<Name>ThemeConfigModel` for example `UiAlertThemeConfigModel`.
This interface allows easy application of a theme based on its properties.

# TAG_NAME
To define the key that each component needs to inject it's theme a TAG_NAME is associated for ALL components in the library.
This key is also used in the accessibility injection.

# Why not use css for this?
As you can see theaming using this method could be accomplished by just replacing the respective css classes in a css file.
But with this method you can have two advantages:
1. By having models to reflect the theame is easier to know what you are changing.
2. JSON can be dynamically generated, wich allows frameworks like tailwind to only use the classes that are needed.
